                    <p className='justification mb-5 mt-3'>I am Sunjida Akter, an aspiring learner, who wants to be a full stack web developer & wants to make changes that encourage people. Although currently my experience in the web developing sector is very low. But I want to prepare myself in such a way that I can gain unlimited skills in every sector of web development. On this ride, Programming Hero Community is helping me to make my dream come true. For now, I would like to complete this course successfully. I would like to take a job or internship to gain more experience at the end of this course and I will do my best for this In Sha Allah.</p>
